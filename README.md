Recently it was announced that ramda passed the 1 million downloads mark which was pretty cool. I expressed how I think ramda is a really nice community including the various surrounding projects such as sanctuary, the stuff from DrBoolean, fantasyland and so on and so forth. This led to my idea of having a virtual get together: An online conference about functional programming with Javascript. My initial thought was `ramdaconf` but since I would not want to limit it soley to Ramda a different name should probably chosen down the road.

I created this repository to get started with collecting some ideas on how to pull this off and finding people interested in giving talks or organizing the event.

For now there is not much to see here beyond the issues where I would like to trigger some brain storming on obvious questions that need to be answered. Please feel free to chime in and create new tickets as you see fit.
