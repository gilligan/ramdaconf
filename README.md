# ramdaconf
virtual conference about javascript and functional programming

Recently it was announced that ramda passed the 1 million downloads mark which was pretty cool. I expressed how I think ramda is a really nice community including the various surrounding projects such as sanctuary, the stuff from DrBoolean, fantasyland and so on and so forth. This led to my idea of having a virtual get together: An online conference about functional programming with Javascript. My initial thought was `ramdaconf` but since I would not want to limit it soley to Ramda a different name should probably chosen down the road.

I created this repository to get started with collecting some ideas on how to pull this off and finding people interested in giving talks or organizing the event.
